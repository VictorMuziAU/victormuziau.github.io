## About Me

I'm a First Class Honours graduate in Psychological Science specializing in complex data analysis and cognitive research. Currently preparing my first-author publication on how executive function components interact with environmental complexity to influence children's safety decisions.

**Current Role:** Research & Product Development Lead at Sophia Cortex, developing AI-assisted mental health support tools that integrate evidence-based psychological interventions with adaptive technology.

## Core Expertise

- **Statistical Analysis:** Mixed-effects models, SEM, factor analysis, bootstrapping
- **Research Methods:** Eye-tracking, experimental design, psychometric assessment  
- **Data Science:** Complex data integration, multi-source dataset management
- **Software:** R, Python, MATLAB, SPSS, jamovi, Git

## Featured Work

**Executive Function & Road-Crossing Safety** - *First author publication in preparation*  
Novel eye-tracking research revealing how cognitive flexibility and inhibition interact with environmental complexity to predict children's safety decisions.

**AI Mental Health Support Development** - *Current project at Sophia Cortex*  
Translating evidence-based therapeutic frameworks into adaptive AI interactions with real-time progress tracking.

Currently seeking research positions where I can apply my quantitative skills and passion for understanding human cognition to meaningful research questions. Particularly interested in cognitive assessment, developmental psychology, and applied psychological research.
